# Compiler Design Lab - Cycle 1

This repository contains the implementation of various compiler design concepts as part of the Compiler Design Laboratory course.

## Experiments

1. [DFA Minimization](DFA_Minimization/) - Implementation of DFA minimization using partition refinement algorithm
2. [Epsilon-NFA to NFA Conversion](Epsilon_NFA_to_NFA/) - Program to convert Epsilon-NFA to NFA by eliminating epsilon transitions
3. [NFA to DFA Conversion](NFA_to_DFA/) - Program to convert NFA to DFA using subset construction
4. [Epsilon Closure](Epsilon_Closure/) - Program to find epsilon closure of all states in an NFA

## How to Run

1. Compile the programs using a C compiler:
   ```
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./program_name
   ```
